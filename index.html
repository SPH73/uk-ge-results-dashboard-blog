          <p>
            The UK's "first past the post" voting system, means that the candidates with the most votes in their
            constiutency wins the seat in the
            House Of Commons.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Charts 1-3 for the 2019 election results, we can see there are a number of parties with a lower
            ratio
            of
            votes to seats and vice versa but most notable are the Scottish National Party having less than half
            of
            the
            number of votes than the Liberal Democrats but 4 times the amount of seats and the Democraot Unionist
            Party
            have just one quater of the amount of Lib Dem votes yet they hold only a few less seats. The Brexit
            Party,
            having gained an overall 644k votes without a seat comapred to The Alliance Party's 134k votes and 1
            seat.
            Again, with only 115k votes the SDLP gained 2 seats while Green gained only 1 with 865K votes. This
            could
            imply a that those parties with the lower seat to vote ratio may have a larger footprint of
            supporters.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next election may prove to make unusual history if we see these new parties gain traction with
            their
            campaigning. The pollsters have suggested that the "conservative strength was pointed to
            'leave-supporters'". Election survey data suggested similar turnout by age-group.
          </p>
          <p>
            Historically we can see in Charts4-5 that not much changed over the past century with the power
            alternating
            back and forth between Conservative and Labour governments, with difference goimg from one extreme to
            the
            other in respect of one party's seat gain over the other.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the period of 2001-2015 there was a much lower turn-out of voters and the elections were
            between 4 and 5 years apart. We can only speculate on the reason why.

          <p>Leading up to the 2019 Elections, I discovered I was ignorant on the topic of British
            politics. Having
            lived as resident abroad for many years, I was likely to waste my first ever vote if I didn’t remedy the
            situation quickly.</p>
          <p>This data visualisation dashboard/blog project on the UK General Elections, has served to provide me with
            a better understanding of our polotical history and contributed to some answers and insights that the raw
            data alone could not.</p>
          <p>I am neither journalist, data scientist or writer; just a software development student at Code Institute
            who, at the time that my questions arose about which way to cast my vote, had just learned the basics of
            the wonderful ‘d3.js’, ‘dc.js’ and ‘crossfilter.js’ libraries and wanted to experiment with them some more
            and
            found this to be a great opportunity to explore both subjects.</p>
          <p>At the very least, whether by chance or for reason, I hope that my visitors enjoy the presentation of
            data and I am optimistic that everyone may glean some insights, as I have done, from being able to discern
            the
            patterns and changes in the charts.</p>

          <p>
            There are many new politial parties on the block and some could be accused of making a mockery of the
            space
            governing the country. One cannot help but wonder how Monster Raving Looney Party secured 200% more votes
            than
            the Animal Welfare Party. In spite of the fact that the oldest standing parties are still winning the
            power
            struggle, I think it begs the question - What is politics coming to?
          </p>
          <p>
            England has the oldest parliament in the world, having met for the first time in the Palace of
            Westminster,
            or the Houses of Parliament as it's called today, in 1265.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two parties were formed as a result of the constitutional crisis
            between 1678 and 1681, known as the Exclusion Crisis, namely 'Whigs' and 'Tories' and an interesting fact
            to
            note is that the descendants of these parties formed the coalition government between 2010 and 2015. I
            wonder what they would have had to say?
